ml automator-->
	1. the ideas:-
		| dark/ light theme toggle button
		| footer, header, sidebar constant/ extendeble
		| organise static files--- main focus on images
		| commenting with examples
		| testcase along with bugs
		| track the task daily(sat/sun)
		| task must be independent(front-end not depend on back-end) **
		| reusable code **
		| download final result in csv format
		| jupyter notebook
		| the task that are performed show usefull links associated with that task.
		| chatbot:- text to speech and vice versa.
		| test your knowledge --- mcq, read articles, questions.
		| search dataset and scrapping that data from kaggle.
		| pycaret.
		| tracking best  parameters/ tech for any particular dataset. and applying the ml models to learn from them so that we can do better in automation...
		| upload data directly or upload data with train, valid and test seperatly.
		| automatically applying the ml techs even after the user left the site and if the results are better then sending the result to that user via email.
	2. apps:-
		1. default home page:- 
		     | latest news related to ml
		     | latest blogs related to ml
		     | main features
		     | plan -- free/ paid --- number of plan/ limitation must be dynamic
		     | faq
		     | our team

		2. authentication:- email(login, signup)
		     | location.
		     | full name.
		     | email.
		     | password.
		     | confirm password.
		     | signup, login :-- use same page.
		     | forgot password.
		     | show default home page when clicked on logo.
		     | proffession/ status-- student, professor
		     | login/signup with github/ kaggle
		     | location based email sending.

		3. main page:- data upload
		     | info of the user's plan
		     | manual or automate completly
		     | select problem statement
		     | data preprocessing
			| datatypes
			| columns
			| null values -- fill, drop
			| normalizing/ standardize -- acc to model
			| outliers
			| value counts
			| tracking cat/ num cols
			| encoding
			| imbalance feature
		     | model selection
			| appropriate model selection acc to loss/ acc
			| hypertunning
			| stacking
			| blending
			| voting tech
			| pipelines
			| ann
		     | EDA
			| diff plots that sit...
		     | feature engineering
			| linear combinations
			| date, location, name columns
			| grouping data acc to cat feature and feed to diff models
			| manipulate any feat on some basis.
			| dimensionality reduction.
			
		     | feature selection
			| if two feat are directly prop to each other then one of them can be removed without any tension.
			| getting corr and selecting the feat acc to that.
			| PCA.
